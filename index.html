        <h2 id="ajit-pai">Who is Ajit V. Pai?</h2>
        <p>Ajit V. Pai is the chairman of the FCC c. January 2017. Appointed by President Trump, Mr. Pai aims to revoke the <a href="https://transition.fcc.gov/Reports/1934new.pdf#page=35">Title II</a> classification of ISPs as common carriers. This would
          mark the end of Net Neutrality as we know it, giving Internet Service Providers (ISPs) complete power over the internet - including the ability to outright ban certain websites on their network.</p>
        <p>Ajit has spent several years as a lawyer for Verizon, and is seen more as an "ally to broadcasters" (television) than to the FCC.</p>

        <h2>What are his intentions?</h2>
        <p>His intentions are simple: To make more money for existing monopolies/duopolies that control the United States. Here's what ISPs can do without the restrictions currently in place: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create "Internet Highways" - that is to say, <b>extort companies for more bandwidth <a href="#ex_1">on top of paying for bandwidth in their plan.</a></b></li>
          <li>Create website packages - without Net Neutrality we may have to <b>pay to access certain websites and services. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/qtENxAG.jpg">Imagine that.</a></b></li>
          <li><b>And more...</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>His intentions are purely monetary. In fact, Ajit Pai removed the site for sending comments to the FCC: (previously https://www.fcc.gov/general/send-us-your-comments, this is still the top result on <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=send+a+comment+to+the+fcc&t=ffab&ia=web">Duck Duck Go</a>).
          Now commenting is obscured and more difficult: https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/how-comment#comments.

        <h2 id="title_II">What is Title II?</h2>
        <p>Title II is part of the Communications Act of 1934. In essence, it prevents service providers from abusing customers. In 2015, an update of the Communications Act came into effect, it modernized the literature and reclassified ISPs under Title
          II as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carrier">"common carriers"</a>. This change gives the FCC oversight of ISPs, allowing them to ensure net neutrality (see <a href="#Net_Neutrality">What is Net Neutrality?</a>), and even set
          prices for services provided by ISPs.</p>

        <h2 id="net-neutrality">What is Net Neutrality and the Open Internet?</h2>
        <p>Net Neutrality is the internet’s guiding principle: It preserves our right to communicate freely online. Net Neutrality means an internet that enables and protects free speech. It means that ISPs should provide us with open networks — and shouldn’t
          block or discriminate against any applications or content that ride over those networks. Just as your phone company shouldn’t decide who you call and what you say on that call, your ISP shouldn’t interfere with the content you view or post online.
          Without Net Neutrality, cable and phone companies could carve the internet into fast and slow lanes. An ISP could slow down its competitors’ content or block political opinions it disagreed with. ISPs could charge extra fees to the few content
          companies that could afford to pay for preferential treatment — relegating everyone else to a slower tier of service. This would destroy the open internet.

        <h2 id="implications">What does all of this mean?</h2>
        <p>If Pai's plans come to fruition, ISPs will no longer be regulated by the FCC. Instead, it will be up to the FTC to protect consumers (read "EVERYONE", including businesses!) from harmful business practices. ISPs have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality#By_issue">actively fought net neutrality in the past</a>,
          and they're certain to continue.</p>
        <p>Without FCC intervention, ISPs can block access to sites, extort companies for using more bandwidth than others, and cap and throttle network speeds for users - <i>and they have.</i></p>
        <p><b>We cannot allow this type of behaviour to continue.</b></p>

        <h2 id="potential-problems">Potential Problems with removing Net Neutrality</h2>
        <h3 id="ex_1">Extortion of Businesses</h3>
        <p>An up and coming streaming service, "webflicks", sweeps the nation. They use a lot of bandwidth, and pay for that bandwidth accordingly. A large ISP, "Corncats", refuses to update their infrastructure and in turn can't handle all this new traffic.
          So, despite paying for a certain bandwidth, webflicks still isn't getting 100% out of it. The average speed for consumers in the area drops down to 1Mbps. Yikes. Corncats decides to strike a deal with webflicks. If webflicks pays Corncats, the
          ISP will increase the bandwidth going to the webflicks website. Simultaneously, this slows down all other traffic going through Corncats infrastructure. Sounds bad right? Well, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but... <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality#Peering_discrimination">This has already happened</a></b>.
